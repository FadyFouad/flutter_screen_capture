## Usage

### Capture the entire screen

```dart
final area = await ScreenCapture().captureEntireScreen();
```

### Capture a specific area of the screen

```dart
final topLeftCorner = Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, 100, 100);
final area = await ScreenCapture().captureScreenArea(topLeftCorner);
```

### Capture a single pixel color

```dart
final color = await ScreenCapture().captureScreenColor(100, 100);
```

### Widgets

There are 2 widgets you can use to see a live preview of a screen area or a pixel color.
They both display what's under the mouse cursor.

Screen area preview:

```dart
SizedBox(
  width: 72,
  height: 72,
  child: ScreenAreaLiveView(areaSize: 72 / 4),
)
```

Color live preview:

```dart
SizedBox(
  width: 48,
  height: 48,
  child: ScreenColorLiveView(),
)
```
